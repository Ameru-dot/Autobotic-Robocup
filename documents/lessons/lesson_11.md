# Lesson 11: Full Run & Troubleshooting

Use this file as context to generate a 90-minute lesson plan.
Output should include: title, objective, prerequisites, 90-minute schedule (time blocks), activities, assessment, and homework.
Keep tools and examples aligned with the repo paths listed below.

## Objective
To identify, diagnose, and resolve system-level issues through full-course testing.

## Learning outcomes
- Run main.py and track system status values.
- Diagnose failures by checking camera, sensor, motor logs.
- Document issues and fixes in a run log.

## Repo context
Use code from the Autobotic_v3 folder in this repository.

## Key files
- `robot_v.3/Python/Autobotic_v3/main.py`
- `robot_v.3/Python/Autobotic_v3/main_test.py`
- `robot_v.3/Python/Autobotic_v3/ui_tk.py`

## Key technical points
- main_test.py runs without motor/Arduino for safe debugging.
- UI displays status and calibration state.
- Troubleshooting uses process-by-process isolation.

## Suggested activities
- Run full system on a short track.
- Stop at each failure and identify root cause.
- Record fixes and retest.

## Assessment ideas
- Short quiz or checklist based on outputs above.
- Student demo or log submission.
