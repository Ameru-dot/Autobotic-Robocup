# Lesson 7: Mechanical Reliability

Use this file as context to generate a 90-minute lesson plan.
Output should include: title, objective, prerequisites, 90-minute schedule (time blocks), activities, assessment, and homework.
Keep tools and examples aligned with the repo paths listed below.

## Objective
To ensure mechanical alignment and stability for consistent robot performance during runs.

## Learning outcomes
- Check wheel alignment and chassis rigidity.
- Identify mechanical sources of drift and vibration.
- Create a pre-run mechanical checklist.

## Repo context
Use code from the Autobotic_v3 folder in this repository.

## Key files
- `documents/mine_setup.md`

## Key technical points
- Omni wheels amplify misalignment effects.
- Camera mount vibration affects line stability.
- Loose connectors cause intermittent failures.

## Suggested activities
- Inspect chassis and wheel mounts.
- Check camera bracket rigidity.
- Create a mechanical checklist for race day.

## Assessment ideas
- Short quiz or checklist based on outputs above.
- Student demo or log submission.
